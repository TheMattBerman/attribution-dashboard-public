# Google Search Console Data in Attribution Dashboard

## üîç What You're Currently Seeing

### **The 4455 Number**

- **What it is**: **Estimated** branded search volume (not real Google Search Console data)
- **How it's calculated**: `total_mentions √ó 15` (estimation multiplier)
- **Data source**: Based on social media mentions from your APIs

### **"Based on X mentions" Text**

- This shows the actual number of social media mentions used for the estimation
- **Previously showed "0 mentions"** due to a frontend bug (now fixed)
- **Should now show the correct mention count** from your social media APIs

## üìä Current Data Sources

The dashboard currently shows **estimated data** because:

1. ‚ùå **Google Search Console not connected**
2. ‚ùå **Google Analytics 4 not connected**
3. ‚úÖ **Social media mentions available** (from ScrapeCreators/Exa APIs)

## üîß How to Get Real Google Search Console Data

### Step 1: Set up GA4 Integration

Google Search Console data flows through the GA4 integration:

```bash
# Add to your .env file:
GA4_PROPERTY_ID=your-property-id-here
GA4_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/path/to/service-account.json
# OR
GA4_CREDENTIALS_JSON='{"type":"service_account",...}'
```

### Step 2: Create GA4 Service Account

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a service account for your project
3. Download the JSON credentials file
4. Enable the Google Analytics Data API

### Step 3: Connect Property

1. Add the service account email to your GA4 property as a Viewer
2. Note your GA4 Property ID (format: 123456789)

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install google-analytics-data google-auth google-auth-oauthlib
```

### Step 5: Restart Dashboard

```bash
python backend_server.py
```

```

### **Future (Real GSC Data)**

```
Branded Search: 2,847
Source: "Google Analytics 4"

```

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### "Still seeing estimated data after setup"

1. Check server logs for GA4 connection errors
2. Verify service account has proper permissions
3. Confirm GA4_PROPERTY_ID is correct
4. Test connection via API endpoint: `/api/test-connection`

### "Numbers seem too high/low"

- **Estimated data** uses rough multipliers (mentions √ó 15)
- **Real data** will be more accurate and likely different
- **Social mentions ‚â† search volume** (different behaviors)
